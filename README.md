## About
**Bank Loan Analysis – Power BI Dashboard** is an interactive, end-to-end report built in **Microsoft Power BI** to analyze a bank's loan portfolio. The dashboard summarizes key KPIs (total customers, total loan amount, average interest rate, revolve balance), visualizes loan distribution by purpose, year-wise loan trends, home ownership segmentation, state-wise repayment status, and grade/sub-grade risk exposure. It helps product managers, risk analysts, and business stakeholders explore loan behaviour, identify high-risk segments, and make data-driven decisions.
