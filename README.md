## 📌Overview
This Power BI dashboard provides a detailed analysis of bank loan performance and customer behaviour. It highlights key KPIs such as total customers, total loan amount, average interest rate, and revolving balance. The dashboard also visualizes loan distribution by purpose, yearly trends, grade-wise and sub-grade risk categories, home-ownership segmentation, and state-wise loan status.  

The goal of this project is to help understand loan patterns, identify high-risk areas, and support data-driven decision-making in banking operations. The visuals allow easy exploration of repayment behaviour, customer segments, and loan growth trends.
